**About 5G Broadcasting**

Traditionally, media broadcast cameras deployed to cover major sporting, cultural, news gathering, and entertainment events are either hard-wired or use dedicated wireless unidirectional RF radio channels to transmit video footage to the production desk. However, with advancement in video resolution to HD and UHD formats and increasing requirements for low latency video transfer and bi-directional camera control, private 5G-enabled broadcast connectivity is showing how it can enable new and more creative production workflows and operational benefits for broadcasters and other stakeholders. 5G connectivity also helps to replace the need for outside-broadcast trucks and extensive cabling.
