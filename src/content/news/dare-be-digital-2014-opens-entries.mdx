Dare to be Digital, the world’s leading computer game design competition for students, opens today for entries – a unique opportunity for aspiring game developers to win their very own BAFTA.

Entries should be made online at [http://www.daretobedigital.com/](http://www.daretobedigital.com/) 

Hosted and run by Abertay University, hundreds of students every year apply to Dare to be Digital to build a working game prototype in just eight weeks. An expert panel picks 15 teams of five students to take part in the contest.

The games then go on show to the public and to industry experts in Dundee in August, with three winning teams picked to compete for the BAFTA Ones to Watch Award.

Previous Dare to be Digital winners include Sophia George, who is currently the V&A’s first ever Game Designer in Residence.

Sophia George, V&A Game Designer in Residence, said: “Dare to be Digital was a life-changing opportunity for me. Being able to work solidly on our game Tick Tock Toys and then show it to thousands of members of the public was an incredible learning experience, and one which really helped me when it came to applying to the V&A.

“I don’t think it’s possible to learn more about entering the games industry in eight weeks than by taking part in Dare to be Digital – the challenge and the support you receive is incredible, as is the mentoring from industry professionals.

“It’s intense, exciting and exhausting, but if you want to make games for a living you’d be crazy not to apply to take part in Dare to be Digital.”

Professor Louis Natanson, who leads computer games education at Abertay University, said: “Dare to be Digital really encapsulates Abertay University’s approach to teaching games artists, audio engineers, designers and programmers. Real-life experience and direct access to industry professionals is essential if you want to enter this exciting, competitive industry.

“In eight weeks we see students absolutely transformed by Dare to be Digital. There’s no question that it’s a really tough challenge, but building a completely new game as part of a small team then showcasing it to thousands of people is a unique experience – and one that can massively help you prepare to be a professional game developer.”

All of the games from Dare to be Digital are shown at the Dare ProtoPlay festival in Dundee’s Caird Hall and City Square on 7th-10th August. Last year’s event attracted 13,000 visitors over four days.

Competitors from Dare to be Digital 2013 will compete in March for the next BAFTA Ones to Watch Award, with Project Heera: Diamond Heist, Size DOS Matter and The Unknown nominated for the prize.
