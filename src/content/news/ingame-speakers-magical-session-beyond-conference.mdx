Hosted by this year’s MC [Joanna Abeyie MBE](https://beyondconference.org/speakers/joanna-abeyie-mbe/), Founder & Chief Executive Officer of Blue Moon, BEYOND brought together speakers from across the creative and digital industries to share research, personal insights and, let's be honest, some really cool work and innovation.
