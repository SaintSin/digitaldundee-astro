4G mobile broadband will be available in Dundee from the end of 2013.

People in the city will see an improved, faster experience when using the internet on their mobile phones, laptops or tablets — with speeds five times faster than 3G technology.

Digital Dundee businesses said the move will be a real boost for the local economy and “position us as a smart, intelligent, tech savvy city”.

The new 4G will be delivered by mobile network EE, which is investing £150 million in rolling out superfast broadband in Scotland.

Olaf Swantee, Chief Executive Officer, EE, said:

“With every new town and city we switch on, the 4G revolution picks up pace. From Bath to Bournemouth, Northampton to Newastle-under-Lyme, today’s towns and cities are the latest in a long line to get 4G from EE. By Christmas, 160 places across the UK will have 4G access, meaning that people and businesses can do more, trade more and connect more. That’s the fastest rollout of 4G in Europe, and with well over one million people already using the service, one of the most successful too. With the competition lagging behind and barely reaching double figures for 4G cities, it means there’s only one real choice for 4G this Christmas.”

Derek Smith, regional manager for east Scotland, EE, said: “The arrival of 4G here is great news for our customers.

“4G from EE is like having fibre broadband to your mobile phone, and allows customers to access the content they care about without the frustration of pages being slow to load, or apps not connecting.”

Deputy first minister and cabinet secretary for infrastructure, investment and cities, Nicola Sturgeon, said the advancement would help Scotland become a world leading digital nation by 2020. She said: “The launch of EE’s 4G service opens up new opportunities for people and businesses in Dundee to access next generation mobile technology.

“4G’s increased speeds and coverage make it easier and more attractive to access online digital services.”
