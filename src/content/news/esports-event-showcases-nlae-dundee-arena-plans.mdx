**NLAE shares new images and video for the proposed state-of-the-art esports Dundee Arena**

**during SEL4 grand finals**

- *In order to mark the Scottish Esports League 4 (SEL4) grand finals, Northern Lights Arena Europe (NLAE) shares new concept art for its proposed state-of-the-area multi-purpose e-sports arena on the Dundee waterfront*

- *The arena will be Europe’s first truly digital enabled arena space and attract top gamers and entertainers from across the globe *

Northern Lights Arena Europe (NLAE) is sharing new concept images and a [concept video](https://vimeo.com/639599098/8f96e2bdd5) for its proposed esports arena at Dundee’s waterfront. Following the announcement of NLAE’s exclusivity agreement with Dundee City Council last year, the company is releasing this concept art at the [Scottish Esports League 4 (SEL4) grand finals ](https://www.digitaldundee.com/event/sel4-finals-scottish-esports-league-2021)held 18-21 November in Dundee.

The SEL4 finals will play an instrumental role in building the profile of Dundee’s Esports scene. Along with being a home to the world’s top gamers, the arena will also provide local education facilities, promote life-long skills, and boost digital fluency. NLAE will work in partnership with Abertay University and Dundee & Angus College to build on their first-class gaming curriculum to create an immersive revolutionary e-sports experience through the integration of state-of-the-art classrooms, professional arena operations and e-sports teams. 

NLAE’s state-of-the art arena will be Europe’s first truly digital enabled arena space and a flagship project for Dundee alongside the Eden project and V&A Scotland. The arena, which is due to be delivered in 2024, will have circa 4,000 seats and will be a hub for the e-sports sector, building on Dundee’s already well-established reputation as a leading gaming centre of excellence. 

**Lord Michael Grade, Chairman, NLAE said: ***“We are very excited to be able to share new concept images and video of our proposed arena at Dundee waterfront. As well as creating jobs and boosting the local tourism industry, the arena would create a world-class experience for e-sports fans, both in Dundee and virtually. *
