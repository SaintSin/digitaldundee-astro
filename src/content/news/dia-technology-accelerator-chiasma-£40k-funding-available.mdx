Design in Action Technology Accelerator Chiasma (TAC): Friday 16th January and Friday 30th January, Double Tree by Hilton, Dundee

Design in Action ([www.designinaction.com](http://www.designinaction.com)) along with the University of Dundee's Research and Innovation Services (RIS) invites applications from business, organisations, designers and University of Dundee academics whose discipline has a strong digital imaging focus to take part in the first Technology Accelerator Chiasma (TAC) workshop. This is a fantastic opportunity to meet like-minded people and create a new product or service with up to £40k funding available for commercialisation.

Digital imaging has a huge impact on many aspects of our society, from early disease detection to forensic identification, disaster recovery to climate change visualisation. There are potentially significant global markets that are predicted to rise in the next few years, positioning digital imaging at the forefront of research across many sectors with the capacity to help millions of people across the world.

Design can also play a pivotal role in capitalising and facilitating innovation, as well as taking ideas and realising their commercial potential. 'Our Digital Imaging Futures' TAC will bring world-renowned scientists from the University of Dundee together with designers to work with businesses and organisations in order to capitalise on our collective assets (e.g. knowledge, patents, networks).

With Dundee recently being named as one of the UNESCO 'Cities of Design' around the world, what better time to examine the impact design can have on research!

The Chiasma will take place at the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel in Dundee, from 9am-9pm on Day 1 and 9am - 8pm on Day 2. The event is free to attend and all meals will be provided throughout the event and reasonable travel expenses reimbursed. We can also cover accommodation in the hotel, if required. Designers who meet the qualifying criteria will also have the opportunity to apply for a Design Support Grant worth up to £500 to attend.
