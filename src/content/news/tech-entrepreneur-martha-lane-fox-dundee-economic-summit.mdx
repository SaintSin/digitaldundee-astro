It's on Wednesday 18th June 2025, will feature a range of thought leaders and industry experts, with Martha Lane Fox delivering the pivotal address to a diverse audience of business leaders, policymakers, and innovators.

Martha Lane Fox is a trailblazer in both the digital and entrepreneurial realms. As an entrepreneur, she co-founded Europe's largest travel and leisure website, lastminute.com, in 1998. She helped lead the company to success, taking it public in 2000 and selling it in 2005. Her entrepreneurial journey continued with ventures like LuckyVoice, a karaoke business she co-founded and now chairs, revolutionising the karaoke industry.

Currently, Martha holds key leadership roles in several high-profile organisations. She serves as President of the British Chambers of Commerce, Chancellor of the Open University, and Chair of WeTransfer. She also holds non-executive directorships at Chanel and previously served as a Director of Twitter, until Elon Musk’s takeover in 2022.

Martha’s impact extends beyond business. From 2009 to 2013, she served as the UK’s Digital Champion and played a crucial role in the establishment of the Government Digital Service, transforming the delivery of public services. Her dedication to social causes includes her work as a patron of Day One Trauma, iamtheCODE, and Just for Kids Law.

In recognition of her exceptional contributions, Martha was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2013 and has since become a crossbench peer in the UK House of Lords.

_"The world is increasingly shaped by software, and it's essential that we continue to adapt, collaborate, and drive forward new ideas in business and technology. I look forward to sharing my thoughts on how we can harness the power of these technologies into the economy to create lasting, positive change for businesses and communities alike."_
