A significant development in the gaming world sees eSports Scotland helmed by James Hood merging with eRena Sports, a company led by David Hamilton, co-founder of Digital Goldfish and Executive Vice President of Ninja Kiwi. The newly combined organisation will operate under the eRena Sports brand, with ambitious plans to establish itself as a leading force in both grassroots and professional esports across Scotland—and internationally.

Tay Cities Deal Tay5G was delighted to support eSports Scotland League 4 produced by eSports Scotland's James Hood who welcomed the merger as a hugely positive development for the company and eSports in Scotland and beyond.   

Hamilton expressed confidence in the merger’s potential, stating that eRena Sports is poised to become a dominant player in the global esports industry.

David Hamilton said "I am excited to announce the acquisition of eSports Scotland marking a significant milestone in the Scottish esports landscape". 

eSports Scotland will merge with eRena Sports, where David is the majority shareholder. The expanded entity, which will operate under the eRena Sports brand has ambitions to build a significant presence in both grassroots and professional esports in Scotland and beyond. David, renowned for his work with Ninja Kiwi, believes eRena Sports is poised to emerge as the leading force in Scotland’s esports industry, by forging strong ties with educational institutions and community outreach initiatives, alongside its existing tournament activities and new advisory services to the sporting and corporate sectors.

The merger comes at a time of unprecedented growth for esports worldwide. In 2024 alone, the industry is projected to reach a global market value of $2.39 billion, with an audience exceeding 540 million.

**Scotland’s Growing Esports Landscape**

In Scotland, the eSports scene is gaining momentum, fuelled by rising engagement from students in schools, colleges, and universities, as well as the formation of new teams and players nationwide. However, the industry continues to face challenges related to infrastructure, public recognition, and institutional support.

eRena Sports aims to tackle these issues head-on by developing strong partnerships with educational institutions and launching community engagement initiatives. The goal is to create accessible pathways for young people to gain skills, compete, and build careers in esports—contributing to a sustainable and vibrant Scottish esports ecosystem.

Alongside its grassroots mission, eRena Sports will also support the professional tier of the industry by backing elite players and teams. The company plans to offer strategic advisory services to sports organisations and corporate partners, helping them navigate the esports sector and tap into its fast-growing economic and cultural influence.
