## esports arena planned for Dundee Waterfront

Northern Lights Arena Europe has entered into an exclusivity agreement with Dundee City Council for a proposed 4,000 capacity esports arena at Dundee Waterfront.

esports is experiencing exponential global growth attracting audiences many times greater than for TV and sees teams playing competitive computer games, often for multi-million pound prizes.

NLAE plan to create a multi-purpose arena to host esports and other events plus an esports academy, retail, accommodation and working spaces.

Chair of NLAE is former BBC chair Sir Michael Grade and the board includes Ivan Dunleavy, previously Pinewood Studios.

The arena would be constructed on sites 10 and 11 that sit opposite V&A Dundee between Slessor Gardens and the Tay Road Bridge.

NLAE has also agreed collaboration with Abertay University and Dundee and Angus College in relation to skills.

Technology partners including Amazon Web Services, and low-carbon energy provider Vital Energi.

Dundee City Council leader John Alexander said: "Once again, we are showing the power of Dundee's ambitious agenda. I've always been clear that the city needed to make its elbows felt and that's exactly what we are doing."
