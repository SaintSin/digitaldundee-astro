Dundee's ongoing transformation has led to a recent surge in tourists to the city. New figures released today report a 6.8 percent rise in visitor numbers, highlighting it's fast becoming a ‘go-to' destination.\* To celebrate this tourism boost a new interactive guide to the city - The Dundee App - has been launched with the help of Dundee band <a title="Model Aeroplanes" href="https://www.facebook.com/modelaeroplanes?fref=ts" target="_blank">Model Aeroplanes</a>.

Dundee's thriving tourism sector is now worth £143m to the city, and this is only set to rise as the Waterfront development continues, with experts forecasting that three million people will visit the city between 2012 and 2025.\*\* The free smartphone app contains all the information you need for planning a stay in Dundee and gives visitors and locals alike the chance to explore the city like never before.

Dundee, the city that brought you Grand Theft Auto, is renowned for its technological innovations. Developed by digital gurus, Waracle, the app allows users to search activities by category. It also has an innovative ‘shoogle' function - with a quick shake of the handset, the app generates a completely random event happening that day making it a unique and exciting way to try different activities and ‘shoogle' your way around the city.

Will Dawson, convener of Dundee City Council's city development committee, said: "The changes taking place in Dundee are really starting to take shape so it's great to see that we're already seeing a significant rise in the number of people visiting. As one of Scotland's key cities, Dundee has so much to offer and this new app will give people the chance to discover all there is to see and do with just the touch of a button."It's a handy up-to-the-minute guide and we hope it will become an invaluable resource for people planning a stay in the city as well as a source of inspiration for local people looking to discover new things, from first class restaurants and exciting club nights to live music and family days out.

"Jim Clarkson, VisitScotland's Regional Director for Dundee and Angus, said: "Dundee has always been renowned for its innovation and this new app is a terrific way for visitors to keep up to date with what's happening in the city. We are delighted to see an increase in the number of visitors, something that is surely set to continue with the exciting developments taking place in Dundee over the coming years."

The most comprehensive listings guide to the city by far, the app channels listings from the What's On Dundee website, which is staffed by a full-time team meaning the app stream is continually updated with exciting and up-to-the-minute events and activities. It is also the only app to include complete listings for all of the city's three cinemas.The app is free to download on <a title="Apple App - Dundee" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/dundee-app/id799437052?mt=8" target="_blank">Apple</a> or <a title="App" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waracle.whatson" target="_blank">Android</a> now.
