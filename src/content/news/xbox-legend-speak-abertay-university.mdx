A legend of the computer games industry, who helped to create the Microsoft Xbox, is to speak at Abertay University next Tuesday (8 July).
The event has been organised by IGDA Scotland, the Scottish chapter of the International Game Developers Association.
Ed Fries has worked in the computer games industry for over 30 years and helped to change gaming worldwide with the launch of the Xbox. As Vice President for Games Publishing he also managed the games released for Microsoft’s console.
In 2004 Ed left Microsoft to pursue other opportunities, and today he advises a number of studios and companies as well as running FigurePrints, a service providing 3D prints of player avatars from World of Warcraft.
Luke Dicken, Chair of IGDA Scotland, said: “This is a wonderful opportunity for the nation's game developers and I'm thrilled that IGDA Scotland has been able to arrange such an incredible guest.
“Ed's wisdom and insight have been one of the personal highlights of my time serving with him on the IGDA's Board of Directors and it is an absolute privilege to be able to share that with our community during this event."
The event will see Ed discussing his career, achievements and advice in conversation with Luke Dicken, and responding to audience questions.
Professor Louis Natanson, Head of the School of Arts, Media and Computer Games at Abertay University, said: “We’re delighted to be welcoming a true legend of the games industry to Abertay University, to share his phenomenal experience of leading games publishing at Microsoft.
“Ed is a very inspirational figure to the aspiring game developers and entrepreneurs coming through Abertay University and working nearby in Dundee. There’s a great deal of excitement here ahead of his visit.”
