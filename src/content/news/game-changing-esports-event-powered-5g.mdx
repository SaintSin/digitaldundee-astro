The finals were a key milestone on our journey towards establishing Dundee as a hub for competitive gaming prior. I would like to thank our partners for playing a major role in enabling us to host an event of this calibre."

Mark Flynn, Convener of Dundee City Council’s City Development Committee, said: “Long-term investment, years of planning and the vision to anticipate the next big thing makes Dundee almost the perfect location for what will be the nation’s largest competitive gaming competition to date. The Scottish Esports League Season 4 helped to cement Dundee’s place on the map as a key centre for competitive gaming, and I am sure that its success will make it the first of many such events hosted in the city.”<o:p></o:p>

Derek Graham, Digital Infrastructure Programme Director at Scottish Futures Trust, said: “It’s been great to work with Esports Scotland to help them to become the first user of Dundee City Council’s 5G testbed that SFT has developed and delivered in collaboration with the council."

Congratulations to all involved and a huge thank you to the Scottish Government, Tay Cities Deal and all the sponsors."

Professor Gregor White, Dean of Abertay University’s School of Design and Informatics, said: “Esports represent a massive opportunity for Dundee and Scotland and we are hugely excited to be bringing our academic expertise in video games education to this important sector, and to be partners in the Dundee Esports Arena project. Our plans to offer new programmes and qualifications linked to Esports are progressing well and we are confident that the success currently enjoyed by our games design graduates can be replicated as the industry continues to grow.”<o:p></o:p>

Gillian McGovern, Head of Sector for Creative Cultural and Digital at Dundee and Angus college, said: “We are extremely excited about being a part of the SEL4 event and getting the opportunity to showcase at the DCA. The Esports arena has been a focal point of our discussions at the college over the last year or so and this global event which will be streamed live from Dundee sets the scene of what’s to come for the region. The opening of the arena will provide a number of job opportunities and the college will play a vital part in providing the future workforce with the skills and experience required to fill these roles”.<o:p></o:p>
