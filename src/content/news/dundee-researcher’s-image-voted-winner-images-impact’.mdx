Dundee researcher’s image voted winner of `Images with Impact’

A stunning image produced by a University of Dundee researcher has been voted the winner of the `Images with Impact’ competition.

The image produced by Ian Newton, from the College of Life Sciences at Dundee, wowed visitors to the Great British Bioscience Festival. It showed microtubules but provoked comparisons with Edvard Munch’s famous painting `The Scream’. It was one of eighteen shortlisted pictures on which the public were asked to vote.

“I am delighted with the result,” said Ian. “The image was produced as part of an experiment thanks to excellent image facilities at the University of Dundee. The fact it bears striking similarity to a famous painting was totally coincidental. As happens at times with science, something totally unexpected appears that can be very beautiful.”

The Images with Impact competition was organised by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and sought the best photos that represent how life sciences are changing the world, in areas like food, farming, bioenergy, biotech, industry and health.

Professor Jackie Hunter, BBSRC Chief Executive, said “The wonderful, thought-provoking pictures received through our Images with Impact competition demonstrate the beauty of bioscience, which we have been celebrating in our 20th anniversary year. The competition has proven to be a brilliant opportunity to showcase to the public, interesting perspectives on the range of world-leading bioscience BBSRC funds in the UK.”

Overall winner: Microtubules in vitro by Ian Newton, University of Dundee
