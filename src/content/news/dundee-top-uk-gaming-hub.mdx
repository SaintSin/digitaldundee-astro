## Dundee - fourth-highest for gaming companies in UK 

Scotland has achieved the largest rise in employment in the gaming sector of any of the nations and regions of the UK, reports major real estate firm, Knight Frank in collaboration with industry organisation, Ukie.

Their (RE)Play report observes that the number of people employed in gaming in Scotland grew by 60% from 2017 to 2019, the latest period for which data is available. This puts Scotland top of the table of 12 UK nations and regions. They note the sector is estimated to be worth around £350 million to the Scottish economy.

A spokesman said that based on British Film Institute data, the 60% rise had taken the workforce in the sector in Scotland to almost 5,700.

Knight Frank’s report identifies Dundee as among the UK’s top 20 gaming industry hubs with the fourth-highest concentration of gaming companies.

Alasdair Steele, head of Scotland commercial at Knight Frank, said: “Scotland has a strong track record when it comes to gaming, with Lemmings and Grand Theft Auto among the iconic games to be developed here, and 4J Studios bringing Minecraft to consoles. Dundee is widely recognised for its expertise in digital media and gaming, with Abertay University forming the UK’s first centre for excellence in computer games education.”

Noting the proposal for a new £60m Esports arena with up to 4,000 seats, he added: “The growth of the sector has been strong in recent years, and that only looks like continuing with such a strong skills base and new infrastructure. Property will undoubtedly have its role to play in supporting creativity, attracting and retaining talent, and giving occupiers the flexibility for high growth.”
