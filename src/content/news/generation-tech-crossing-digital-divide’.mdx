**‘Generation-Tech: Crossing the Digital Divide’ – 10<sup>th</sup> November**

Academics from the University of Dundee are inviting the public to cross the digital divide as part of this year’s Dundee Science Festival.

On Thursday, 10th November, computing researchers will lead the ‘Generation-Tech: Crossing the Digital Divide’ event at the Queen Mother Building. They will discuss the ways in which technology can be designed to deliver social and healthcare benefits for older and disabled people while interactive research stations will offer hands-on opportunities for visitors to engage with projects developed at the University.

Dr Jon Urch, Public Outreach Officer at the University, said, “This year we are hosting fascinating events on our campus that give everyone the chance to visit our excellent facilities and meet our researchers. The event focuses on our strengths in health and wellbeing and shaping the future with design.

“It’s an exciting time for city and the University, with science and design essential to our successes. I’d encourage everyone to book their free place at these events to explore how science is shaping the world around us.”

Tickets can be obtained from [www.dundeesciencefestival.org](http://www.dundeesciencefestival.org/).

The University has been running events on consecutive Thursday evenings throughout the 2016 festival, while its researchers have been taking part in many of the other talks, workshops and public engagement sessions.

Launched in 2010, Dundee Science Festival, aims to engage and inspire the whole community through its celebration of science and lifelong learning across the city of Dundee - attracting people from all ages and backgrounds.
