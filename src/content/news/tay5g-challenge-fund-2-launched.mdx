The Tay Cities Deal Tay5G Challenge Fund 2 is a UK-wide grant funding opportunity worth up to £600,000 supported by the Scottish Government. Funding is available for projects that demonstrate and validate innovative products and services for use, adoption or scaling up of 5G supported solutions. Tay5G is led by Dundee City Council and is part of Tay Cities Deal, a programme of regional strategic, social and economic development projects for Tay Cities Region (TCR), supported by the Scottish and UK Governments. TCR takes in the Councils areas of Angus, Dundee, Fife and Perth & Kinross. Project leads and any partners must be UK registered organisations but need not be based in TCR. <a style="-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:transparent;box-sizing:border-box;color:rgb(35, 35, 35);font-family:"Open Sans", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:16px;font-style:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;margin:0px;orphans:2;padding:0px;text-align:start;text-decoration:underline;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;" href="https://www.taycities.co.uk/" rel="noreferrer">Read more about Tay Cities Deal (opens Tay Cities Deal website). </a>
