Take-Two Interactive, the firm behind Scottish Rockstar Games, has revealed Grand Theft Auto V was the best-selling video game of 2013, citing NPD research data.

Rockstar Games sold a whopping 32.5 million copies of Grand Theft Auto V during the year, boosting Take-Two Interactive to record earnings and making it NPD's top video game publisher of 2013.

"Take-Two's business continued to outperform expectations significantly during the fiscal third quarter," said Strauss Zelnick, chairman and CEO of Take-Two.

It's expected Grand Theft Auto V sales will continue to be massive in 2014, as the title still hasn't landed for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, or PC. A rumoured launch date for all three platforms is 13 June, but it has yet to be confirmed by Rockstar Games.

Take-Two Interactive's stock fell slightly in extended trading on Monday, even though the company posted $767 million in revenue, up from $405 million in the same ago quarter of the previous year.
