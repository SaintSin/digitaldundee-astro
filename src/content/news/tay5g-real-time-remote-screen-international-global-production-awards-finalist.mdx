Tay5G Real Time Remote Project Nominated for Screen International Global Production Awards

The ground-breaking Tay5G Real Time Remote project was a finalist for the prestigious Screen International Global Production Awards for its virtual production innovation. This collaborative project was led by Abertay University, Royal Holloway University of London/StoryFutures, and Space Digital based in Manchester. They worked in collaboration with TayScreen, the Fife Tay regional screen office, AWTG and the Scotland 5G Centre.

The project showcases the power of 5G technology in transforming the entertainment and production industries. It focuses on leveraging 5G technology to enable real-time remote production capabilities, revolutionising the way content is created and produced. By harnessing the low latency and high-speed connectivity of 5G networks, the project aims to enhance collaboration, streamline workflows, and bring productions to life in a more efficient and cost-effective manner.

The nomination for the Screen International Global Production Awards is a testament to the innovative and impactful work being done by the Tay5G Real Time Remote project team. The results of the awards are eagerly anticipated in May at the Cannes Film Festival. Hopes are running high for recognition of the project's cutting-edge virtual production solutions.
