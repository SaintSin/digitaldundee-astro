Grand Theft Auto 5 has passed another sales milestone after shifting £1bn worth of copies across the world in just three days – making it the fastest ever entertainment product to reach the magic sum.

The game had already smashing record sales, selling 1.57m units in the UK alone and setting new records in game sales here.

However a statement released by Take Two Interactive Software, who released the game, said that its enormous popularity had led to the even greater achievement.

‘Grand Theft Auto V, the critically acclaimed latest release from the iconic interactive entertainment series, has achieved worldwide retail sales of more than one billion dollars during its first three days on sale, according to company estimates,’ the company said.

We believe this marks the fastest that any entertainment property, including video games and feature films, has reached this significant milestone.’

Take Two’s chairman Strauss Zelnick described the game as a ‘cultural phenomenon’, adding: ‘We are incredibly proud of the extraordinary critical and commercial response to Grand Theft Auto V.’

GTA 5, which was developed by Edinburgh-based Rockstar North and is available on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, has been five years in the making and reportedly cost around £170m.

Fans queued across the UK in a bid to be among the first to get their hands on a copy of the game, with stores staying open late for the launch at midnight on Tuesday.
