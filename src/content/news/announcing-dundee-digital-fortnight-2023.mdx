## **8th November** – Amazon Web Services (AWS) Local Government Roundtable

**"AI and the opportunity it brings to transformation in Local Government"**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been with us for decades, but the latest developments in areas such as Large Language Models (LLM) and Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT) represent the biggest advancements in tech since the internet became widely available. But AI is often misunderstood, and its full range of capabilities are only beginning to be established. While there are many myths about AI, it does present potential challenges – alongside almost limitless opportunities – for local government and the citizens councils serve.

In this roundtable session, you will get chance to deeply engage with the topic and explore with colleagues from across local government, Amazon Web Services and Salesforce on how AI can help you achieve the best outcomes for the citizens you serve.

- **Time:** 10:30 – 12:30
- **Location:** Dundee Contemporary Arts (DCA)
- **Audience:** Aimed at Local Government
