TIGA, the network of developers and digital publishers, said today that now is the time for the UK Government and local governments to promote high technology clusters around the UK.

The trade association representing the UK videogames industry made the comments following the news that the combined business activity of England’s regions rose last month at the quickest pace for over a decade.

According to the Lloyds Bank regional purchasing managers’ index, expansion was fastest in northwest England, followed by the southeast, southwest and London. All 12 UK regions registered growth, with business activity being driven by increased consumer demand and higher investment spending among public and private sector clients.

**Dr Richard Wilson, TIGA CEO**, said:

“Since the onset of the recession there has been a general recognition that the UK economy needs to be rebalanced, with growth coming from exports and business investment and with more activity from the regions outside of London. Lloyds Bank’s research shows encouraging signs, with all 12 UK regions reported growth.

“Now is an opportune time for policy makers to promote the development of high technology clusters as part of a process of ensuring that economic growth benefits all parts of the UK. There are concentrations of games studios in areas including Birmingham, Brighton, Cambridge, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Guildford, Leamington Spa, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle, Oxford, and Sheffield.

“Policy makers can support these clusters and boost start-ups by establishing additional business incubators, fostering local industry and university links, strengthening connections with finance providers and promoting mentoring services for businesses. Now is the time to capitalise on the growing regional recovery and invest in high technology businesses.”
