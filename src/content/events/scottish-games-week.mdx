1st November, Dundee - The Scottish Games Education Network Symposium is a practical, interactive hand-on forum for educators, academics, employers and stakeholders from across the games-related courses in Scotland.

Edinburgh - The SGW Conference is a two-day event, which explores every aspect of designing, creating and releasing games. The conference brings together developers, publishers, tools, technologies and the wider games ecosystem in an inclusive, collaborative and welcoming forum.

Glasgow - Scottish Games Awards - A celebration of excellence of Scottish games talent, the Scottish Games Awards recognise outstanding achievement by individuals, organisations and games.

And More Than Games - The global games ecosystem is far larger than anyone suspects. Alongside millions of consoles, billions of players, hundreds of billions of dollars and blockbuster franchises, games are quietly transforming our world.

Tickets from £45 and concessions available from free.
