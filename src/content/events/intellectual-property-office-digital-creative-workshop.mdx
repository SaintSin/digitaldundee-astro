**Every Business Owns IP: How does it affect you?**

Most successful businesses, large or small, are built on well-managed, intangible assets like intellectual property (IP). Digital businesses create and use IP all the time, perhaps without realising it. Whether it’s the name of your company, the look of a new character in your game, the code of your new program, or even an improved searching algorithm, the value of IP can far outweigh the value of your physical assets.

**Background**

The IPO’s very successful workshop has been expertly adapted specifcally for the digital industries and has now been delivered to a wide range of stakeholders in partnership with a variety of professional bodies. This workshop, run in collaboration with the University of Dundee’s Knowledge Exchange Hub [Design in Action](http://universityofdundee.cmail20.com/t/j-l-krqjut-qhrayhuh-r/), aims to give participants a good overview of IP and how it can impact businesses within the digital industry, a fast-growing sector in the Scottish economy, particularly in Dundee.

**Workshop Description**

The audience is broken up into small teams and presented with a series of five industry-related scenarios which demonstrate the relevance of IP to a business. Once the teams have discussed the scenario amongst themselves, the speaker(s) will take the audience through the answers to the problem.

**Support material**

Question and answer booklets will be provided alongside other relevant booklets relating to the course content.

**Target groups**

Business advisors (accountants, banks, business coaches), entrepreneurs, games studios, designers, policymakers and other businesses in the digital creative industry with a basic to intermediate knowledge of IP.

**Level of expertise**

Basic to intermediate.

**Outcome**

Participants will gain a good understanding of trade marks, patents, copyright, designs and confidentiality.
