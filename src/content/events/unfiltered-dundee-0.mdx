**An in-person and informal catch-up with the Codebase Dundee & Tayside community! Come join Abertay cyberQuarter and Techscaler for a coffee!**

### What is it?

Open to everyone, head to the Abertay cyberQuarter to connect with members of the local tech and business community. Come along for coffee, breakfast and networking!

### What can I expect?

Unfiltered is an opportunity to meet and connect with people from across the tech ecosystem. We like to run Unfiltered with minimal structure, to allow conversations to flow naturally over a coffee. You don’t need a background in tech to join us at Unfiltered, we welcome anyone who is interested in chatting to our community and learning more.

We'll have tea, coffee and a variety of breakfast options ordered from Annie's cafe.

### Who will be there?

Techies, creatives, academics, freelancers, CodeBase staff and anyone interested in meeting peers within the Dundee tech ecosystem and beyond! We also strongly recommend joining the tech [Online Community](https://codebase.mn.co/spaces/9300064/feed), where you can connect with others in your region.
