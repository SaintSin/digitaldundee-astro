The COVID-19 pandemic and acceleration of digital business has seen financial services companies reassess their digital transformation strategy and, in most cases, speed it up. From re-imagining products and services around customer-centricity to developing new business models to meet customer behaviours, banks and financial institutions have gone from laggards in the digital transformation front to potential leaders.

Join the Waracle panel of industry experts as we explore how digital innovation combined with next-generation business models are delivering real business impact. They will also be discussing the importance of design thinking principles and data-driven decision making in order to drive quantifiable business and enhance the end customer experience. Panelists will be sharing their top tips and real-life examples of how they have embraced digital innovation to help build a financial services organisation for the future.

There will also be the opportunity to ask the panel key questions whilst gaining valuable insights into how to apply specific tactics and strategies to help improve your current business pain points.
