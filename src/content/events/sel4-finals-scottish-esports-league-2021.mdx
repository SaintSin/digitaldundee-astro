Esports Scotland is incredibly excited to announce the return of the Scottish Esports League this year, which will be bigger, more ambitious, and more hardcore than ever before! For a start, our combined prize pool will be the biggest in Scottish Esports history, sitting at an astronomical £10,000!

We've also added some new games to our roster; joining the returning titles Rocket League, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Rainbow 6 Siege, are new tournaments League of Legends and Valorant.

We are also absolutely delighted to announce that the finals will be a live LAN event, hosted by Dundee Contemporary Arts centre. This will be our first post-lockdown event and we couldn’t be more hyped!
