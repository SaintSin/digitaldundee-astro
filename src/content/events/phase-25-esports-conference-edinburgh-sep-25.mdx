Participants will learn how focusing on esports within a school environment fosters critical competencies in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). By engaging students in the competitive and strategic nature of esports, we facilitate the development of problem-solving abilities, teamwork, leadership, and technological proficiency. These skills are not just applicable to gaming; they translate seamlessly into real-world scenarios, making students attractive candidates for future employment in a range of sectors.

The conference will also examine how leading industries are actively seeking individuals with esports experience, recognising the unique skill sets they bring. Companies across technology, engineering, and even marketing are incorporating insights gleaned from esports to drive innovation and engagement.

Additionally, it's a great chance to discuss how traditional sports organisations are harnessing the power of esports to strengthen their community ties, enhance learning initiatives, and boost fan engagement. By promoting esports programs, these organisations can foster a spirit of inclusion and excitement that resonates with younger audiences while reaffirming their commitment to education and development.

This comprehensive approach opens the door to a richer understanding of how earlier engagement with esports can shape the future workforce, ensuring that students are not only academically prepared but also equipped with the practical skills needed to thrive in an increasingly digital and interconnected world. Join us for a dialogue that promises to illuminate the many ways esports can enrich education and industry alike.
