Are you ready for the new UK pension laws?

With the newly changed pension laws, you need to be aware of the facts to allow you to plan and budget accordingly.

These two special sessions will guide you through the new process for employers.

These workshops will outline the process and time-sensitive actions required of you.

With fines of up to £2,500 per day for non-compliance, this workshop is essential for any business employing people, or who are looking to employ in the future.
