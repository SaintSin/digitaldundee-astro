Festival of the Future is the University of Dundee's flagship festival programme that celebrates and enhances collaboration between science, arts, and culture. The festival is a celebration of how science, art and culture can inspire in equal measure, and how creative collaborations can help change our lives for the better.

## The festival theme for 2024 is Connections!

From 9-13 October, there's an exciting programme of events exploring the interconnectedness between people and cultures, health and wellbeing, nature, technology and ideas.

With almost 30 activities across the five days in venues across the city, we have lots on offer for families and all ages including workshops, exhibitions, talks and performances. Learn, create, or simply enjoy what will be a space for everyone to come together and celebrate the power of connections.

And see the story on the ground-breaking film, [Gastromancy, by Katherine Fay Allan.](https://digitaldundee.com/news/festival-future-dundee-includes-uplifting-film)

As well as our events and activities there will be free access for all to the Botanic Garden from 9 –13 October.

See the Events tab above for all details and how to book festival activities!

We hope you will join us for the festivities and that you’ll leave with a deeper appreciation of how connections shape our lives and the world around us.
