The summit will bring together an influential audience of business leaders, policymakers, and key stakeholders dedicated to driving economic growth and innovation across Dundee and the surrounding region.

With a focus on collaboration as a catalyst for sustainable economic development, discussions will explore key topics such as the revitalisation of Dundee’s city centre, the growth of entrepreneurial ventures, and strategies to attract new investments that boost productivity and create jobs.

We are also delighted to confirm Philip Bartlett of NatWest, who will deliver an economic update, and Andy MacIver of Message Matters, who will provide expert insights into the intersection of politics and business. Additionally, local voice Andrew Batchelor, founder of Dundee Culture, will offer a unique perspective on Dundee’s evolving identity and the role of community engagement in shaping the city’s future.
