### **Craft & Graft - The Road to Becoming a Renowned Visual Artist**

Craig’s “Acrylic Fusion” has garnered international acclaim, captivating brands, galleries, and art collectors alike. This versatile analogue process involves hand-pouring layers of acrylic paint to create a mesmerising and unique effect.

Craig’s versatility has led to diverse collaborations, including bespoke football artworks for FIFA at the World Cup, match-day narratives for UEFA, iconic basketballs for Wilson and the NBA, and customising American footballs for the NFL. His portfolio extends to creating an iconic “Acrylic Fusion” Taycan for Porsche, designing elegant packaging for Mucho, transforming the W Edinburgh hotel lobby with an immersive mural, and crafting bespoke helmets for Jaguar TCS Racing at the Monaco E-Prix.

Adapting “Acrylic Fusion” to various environments, Craig excels both in the controlled studio setting and in the dynamic atmosphere of live performances, where audiences witness his artistic process in real time.
