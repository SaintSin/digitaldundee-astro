Join Techscaler in the Abertay cyberQuarter for a chance to practice your pitches and public speaking in a friendly, supportive setting.

They are looking for two people to present 5 minute pitches to the group on their startup idea or any other topic they're preparing for. Others in the group will give constructive feedback and there will be short exercises in between to give everyone a chance at public speaking.

### What can I expect?

They're aiming to not only help people in our community refine their startup pitches but to create a positive environment for people to get comfortable with public speaking in general.

They'll be having fun short exercises between the main pitches where we all get a chance at talking for 1 minute on a mystery prompt and sharing our feedback and advice for public speaking. In addition to group feedback, members of the CodeBase Dundee & Tayside team will also be able to give you advice on what makes an effective startup pitch and what to include.

Tea, coffee and snacks will be available throughout.

### When and where is it taking place?

They'll be in a large meeting room on the 1st floor of the Abertay cyberQuarter, located on 1-3 Bell Street, Dundee, DD1 1LH.

### Who will be there?

This event is open to Techscaler members and anyone else in the tech and startup community looking to practice their pitches and public speaking.

This event is organised by CodeBase and Techscaler and in addition to founders, you will also have the opportunity to chat with the CodeBase team and find out more about how CodeBase and Techscaler can support you.
