Join the monthly Dundee Data Meetup, featuring two expert speakers who will share their insights into getting started with data and sustainable business analytics.

## Speakers and Topics

### <strong style="box-sizing:border-box;">1. Sustainability Business Analytics</strong>

<strong style="box-sizing:border-box;">Lingsay Wong</strong>

### <strong style="box-sizing:border-box;">2. Getting started with your data</strong>

<strong style="box-sizing:border-box;">Johnathan Law</strong>

Companies of all sizes have data to make use of! In this talk, we'll look at tooling to get you started on your journey of making that data business ready for analytics - getting it from its source system, loading it into your data warehouse, and then transforming as required! We'll also chat a little about visualising the data, and the tools that are available.

### Johnathan Law

My name is Johnathan, and I'm a 30-something software guy. I graduated from the University of Dundee in 2015 with a First Class BSc in Applied Computing. I've stayed put in Dundee ever since, with my wife and three cats. In 2024, I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, which is definitely taking some getting used to. I am a person-focused individual who is attentive to professional development, growth, and efficiencies at scale.
