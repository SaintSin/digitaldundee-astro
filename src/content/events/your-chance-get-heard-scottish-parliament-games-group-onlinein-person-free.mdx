The next meeting of the Cross-Party Group ([CPG) for Scotland’s Games Ecosystem](https://www.parliament.scot/get-involved/cross-party-groups/current-cross-party-groups/2024/scottish-games-ecosystem) takes place at Glasgow University’s [Advanced Research Centre](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/arc/) (ARC) **and online** on **Monday 18th November**, from **13:00-15:00**.

This meeting of the CPG will focus on two key areas of activity around support for the entire games ecosystem in Scotland and developments in games education.

The CPG will host the first public release of the Action Plan being created by Brian Baglow, as the first step in the creation of a National Games Strategy for Scotland. Brian will discuss the recommendations being made to government, public sector organisations, industry and other stakeholders as part of the consultation process, which will welcome input from participants across the games ecosystem.

Dr Amanda Ford will discuss activity around provision of games education and the opportunities to update and revise the guidance for teaching game design and development across Scotland.

Participants and attendees will be invited to take part in discussion on these topics, introduce additional topics for the CPG and ask questions.

**What is the Cross Party Group (CPG) on the Scotland Games Ecosystem?**

One of many Scottish Parliament Cross Party Groups on different sectors, it provides a platform to bring a sense of unity for games in Scotland, it enables the public to engage with games as a policy point, and is the bedrock for promoting a thriving games ecosystem alongside the enormous benefits that can bring for Scotland’s future as a digital and entrepreneurial society.

The Convenors are Clare Adamson MSP and Michael Marra MSP who are joined by the MSPs Stephanie Callaghan, Maurice Golden and Ross Greer. Many individuals and organisations are members.
