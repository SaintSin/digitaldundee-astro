The CPG will host the first public release of the Action Plan being created by Brian Baglow, as the first step in the creation of a National Games Strategy for Scotland. Brian will discuss the recommendations being made to government, public sector organisations, industry and other stakeholders as part of the consultation process, which will welcome input from participants across the games ecosystem.

Participants and attendees will be invited to take part in discussion on these topics, introduce additional topics for the CPG and ask questions.
