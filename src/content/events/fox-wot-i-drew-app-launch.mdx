'Baum' Launch Event - Friday 22nd Jan 2016, 10-11.30am, University of Dundee Dalhousie Building Design in Action, in partnership with Abertay University's Dare to be Digital competition, are delighted to invite you to A Fox Wot I Drew's exclusive launch event for their mobile game 'Baum' at the University of Dundee's Dalhousie Building. The team, made up of Dan Allan, Dominic Littler and Kai Creedon, originally joined forces for Abertay University’s Dare to be Digital competition in 2014, during which time they won the first Design in Action / Dare Prize for Commercial Potential, worth £20,000. As well as the financial backing, the prize also provided them with studio space and equipment within Abertay’s School of Arts, Media and Computer Games and business, design and marketing support from the University of Dundee’s Design in Action project. The resultant game, 'Baum', is an enchanting, highly-addictive 2D platform game that requires the player to move a droplet of water around a magical forest by drawing a gust of wind with their finger. With inspiration from Sonic the Hedgehog and Gustav Klimt's mural 'The Tree of Life', amongst others, it is due to launch on the Apple App Store on Thursday 21st January and will be available in 12 languages. To coincide with this exciting launch, the team will be giving an educational talk on their experiences starting an independent games company, the various challenges they've faced and overcome and the advice they'd give others who are interested in doing the same. Following the talk, there will be a Q&A before attendees are given the opportunity to play the game in the Dalhousie foyer where light refreshments will also be available. This event is open for school groups and other young people interested in computing, coding and app development, art & design, business studies, music and technology.
