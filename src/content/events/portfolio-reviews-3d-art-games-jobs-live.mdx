This Thursday (27th March) at 3pm UK time Games Jobs Live starts their series of live portfolio reviews. It's something they've not seen done elsewhere (maybe they'll find out why!).

"Harry will be joined by Bethany Browne, Recruitment Specialist, and Martin Kirkley, Associate Art Director, from Stellar Entertainment who have worked on Need for Speed, Horizon Zero Dawn, and are now hiring for a AAA arcade racing game built in Unreal 5."

This livestream will have a focus on 3D Art portfolios, so Harry, Bethany and Martin will take a look through some environmental and character art portfolios submitted especially for this.

It's a great opportunity to see how recruiters and hiring managers work, and we hope it gets you thinking about what changes you can make to your portfolio to immediately make the best impression. Even if your portfolio isn't selected, or you're a different discipline entirely, we expect lots of interesting observations and recommendations on applying for new jobs.

And let them know in the comments which bits of the stream you find most useful so they can iterate on the format for future livestreams.
