**An in-person and informal catch-up with the Codebase Dundee & Tayside community! Come join Techscaler by Coddebase for a coffee!**

### **What is it?**

Open to everyone, join us at the Abertay cyberQuarter to connect with members of the local tech and business community. Come along for coffee, breakfast and networking!

### **What can I expect?**

Unfiltered is an opportunity to meet and connect with people from across the tech ecosystem. We like to run Unfiltered with minimal structure, to allow conversations to flow naturally over a coffee. You don’t need a background in tech to join us at Unfiltered, we welcome anyone who is interested in chatting to our community and learning more.
