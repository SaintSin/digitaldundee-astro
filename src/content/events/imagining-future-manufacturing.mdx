Engineers, manufacturers, University researchers (all levels) and industry or community representatives with an interest in contributing to collaborative projects to develop and deliver improvements to manufacturing are invited to join us for Imagining the Future of Manufacturing, an interactive workshop.

The workshop aims to identify potential joint projects for manufacturing innovation: new or improved processes; systems; products and technologies; and services and delivery methods that improve the manufacturing industry.
