### **What is it?**

Open to everyone, join us at the Abertay cyberQuarter to connect with members of the local tech community. Come for a coffee, networking and build connections.

### **What can I expect?**

Unfiltered is an opportunity to meet and connect with people from across the tech ecosystem. We like to run Unfiltered with minimal structure, to allow conversations to flow naturally over a coffee. You don’t need a background in tech to join us at Unfiltered, we welcome anyone who is interested in chatting to our community and learning more.

### **When is it?**

Unfiltered takes place on the first Wednesday of the month. Please feel free to drop in at any time between 08:30 to 10:30 and stay on to hotdesk.

### **Where is it?**

We'll be on the ground floor of the Abertay cyberQuarter: just across from the main campus and right next to Annie's cafe.

### **Who will be there?**

Techies, creatives, academics, freelancers, CodeBase staff and anyone interested in meeting peers within the Dundee tech ecosystem and beyond! We also strongly recommend joining our [Online Community](https://codebase.mn.co/spaces/9300064/feed), where you can connect with others in your region.

### **Registration**

We ask everyone to sign up individually, so we can have an estimate of how many people want to attend. We will also check-in each person on Eventbrite as they join the event so make sure you've signed up to the event in order to attend!

_Tickets are very limited so be sure to register!_
