### <strong style="box-sizing:border-box;padding-top:0px;">What is it?</strong>

Open to everyone, join us at the Abertay cyberQuarter to connect with members of the local tech community. Come for a coffee, networking and build connections.

### <strong style="box-sizing:border-box;padding-top:0px;">What can I expect?</strong>

Unfiltered is an opportunity to meet and connect with people from across the tech ecosystem. We like to run Unfiltered with minimal structure, to allow conversations to flow naturally over a coffee. You don’t need a background in tech to join us at Unfiltered, we welcome anyone who is interested in chatting to our community and learning more.

### <strong style="box-sizing:border-box;padding-top:0px;">When is it?</strong>

Unfiltered takes place on the first Wednesday of the month. Please feel free to drop in at any time between 08:30 to 10:30 and stay on to hotdesk.

### <strong style="box-sizing:border-box;padding-top:0px;">Where is it?</strong>

We'll be on the ground floor of the Abertay cyberQuarter: just across from the main campus and right next to Annie's cafe.

### <strong style="box-sizing:border-box;padding-top:0px;">Who will be there?</strong>

Techies, creatives, academics, freelancers, CodeBase staff and anyone interested in meeting peers within the Dundee tech ecosystem and beyond! We also strongly recommend joining our <a style="background-color:transparent;box-sizing:border-box;color:var(--eds-control,#3659e3);padding-top:0px;text-decoration:underline;" href="https://codebase.mn.co/spaces/9300064/feed" title="https://codebase.mn.co/spaces/9300064/feed" target="_blank" data-msys-clicktrack="0" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Online Community</a>, where you can connect with others in your region.
