### **What is it?**

Open to everyone, join us in Kinross' Court House to connect with members of the local tech and business community and regulars of The Court House's workspace. Come along for coffee, breakfast and networking!

### **What can I expect?**

This is an opportunity to meet and connect with people from across the tech and business ecosystem in Kinross and Central Scotland. We like to run these events with minimal structure, to allow conversations to flow naturally over a coffee. You don’t need a background in tech to join us, we welcome anyone who is interested in chatting to the community and learning more.

### **Who will be there?**

Techies, creatives, academics, freelancers, CodeBase staff, those who work in The Court House and anyone interested in meeting peers within the Dundee tech ecosystem and beyond! We also strongly recommend joining our [Online Community](https://codebase.mn.co/spaces/9300064/feed), where you can connect with others in your region.
