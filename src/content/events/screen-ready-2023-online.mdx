Are you a location or business that wants to work with film and TV production? Perhaps you already do. Join us online for our **free** morning event on Wednesday, 6th December at 10am. We’re excited to welcome:

- **Tim Maskell, Scottish Location Services**

- **Mat Bett, Abertay University, Virtual Production**

- **Joshua Ryan-Saha, Director, Traveltech, Edinburgh Futures Institute**

We’ll be hearing about media production which brings spending on locations and services and promotes the region, attracts tourism and boosts the regional economy. It’s also a chance to find out about the growing new trend of virtual production and what this means for locations. We will also hear about the [Tay Cities Region Traveltech Challenge](https://www.traveltech.scot/project/traveltech-for-tay-cities) for tourism businesses to try out all kinds of technology to help with areas like getting staff and promotion.
