<h5>Edutech 2021</h5>

Digital teaching and learning pedagogies have been fundamental to the continuity of education during lockdown. As schools across the country shut down, teachers turned to technology in order to maintain contact with pupils.. More than 12 months since the first wave of Covid-19 and remote and blended digital teaching and learning models have now bedded into everyday practice, with confidence and expertise growing in digital delivery.

At EduTech 2021, some of the leaders of national efforts to initiate live and recorded activities – supplemented by a growing range of online resources - will share some of their lessons from lockdown and how they might shape the future of education in Scotland. With a new National e-Learning Offer (NeLO), and a nationwide inspection programme of local efforts helping to benchmark success, a framework has emerged that is consolidating digital teaching and learning practice.
