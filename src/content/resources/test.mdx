  title: "4G’s speeding to Dundee"
  description: "4G mobile broadband will be available in Dundee from the end of 2013. People in the city will see an improved, faster experience when using the internet on their mobile phones, laptops or tablets — with speeds five times faster than 3G technology. Digital Dundee businesses said the move will be a real boost for the local economy and “position us as a smart, intelligent, tech savvy city”. The new 4G will be delivered by mobile network EE, which is investing £150 million in rolling out superfast broadband in Scotland."
