**Dundee named Outstanding Entrepreneurial University of the Year at Times Higher Education Awards**

The University of Dundee has been named the UK’s Outstanding Entrepreneurial University of the Year in the 2024 Times Higher Education Awards, held in Birmingham last night (28 November).

The judges said, “Dundee has always had a strong entrepreneurial offer to its students and staff. This has now been cemented by a strategy and a vision, creating an entrepreneurial culture across the whole university. It demonstrates enterprise and entrepreneurship at its core with its programme embracing all, including its community.”

The award follows other recent accolades for Dundee, which was named Innovative & Entrepreneurial University of the Year in the Triple E Awards for Europe in September, and also Scottish University of the Year by the Daily Mail University Guide.

Dr David McBeth, Vice-Principal Enterprise & Economic Transformation, said, “This award from Times Higher Education further recognises our commitment to enterprise and entrepreneurship, and our strong track record in creating new businesses based on the ideas and innovations of our entrepreneurial staff, students and alumni.

“My thanks go to everyone in the University who has helped achieve this. We all share in the recognition this award brings.”

John Gill, editor of Times Higher Education, said, “This 20th anniversary year of our awards brought another record number of submissions detailing, as ever, a dazzling array of achievements from institutions, teams and individuals, and demonstrating that even though times are tough, the creativity and energy in UK and Irish universities remains undiminished.”
